markdown__bio: Uncertain if he's a coder who writes or a writer who codes, James
  tries to funnel as much of this existential tension as possible into both of
  his passions but finds it of more benefit to his writing than his software.
  When occasionally hopping out from behind his keyboard, he can be found
  jogging and cycling around suburban Japan.
