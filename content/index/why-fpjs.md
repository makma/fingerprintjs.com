    content: "Fingerprinting technology is the backbone of most major fraud
      detection solutions. Fingerprinting identifies unique visitors and
      associated sessions, undeterred by incognito browsing, VPNs, cookie
      blockers, and other technologies used to anonymize fraudulent actors
      online.  The technology works by analyzing data passed by the visitor's
      browser, device, patterns of use, and more to generate a unique visitorID
      that can associate patterns of fraud with specific visitors. "
