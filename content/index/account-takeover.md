      title: Credential Stuffing Prevention
      content: Users that re-use passwords across multiple services are at risk of
        having their accounts accessed by fraudsters who purchased or hacked
        their account information from elsewhere. These fraudsters may then test
        thousands of login credentials on your site to gain access. Stop the
        threat by associating multiple login attempts from bot networks and
        preventing additional attempts from related visitorIDs using
        FingerprintJS Pro.

      title: Phishing Attack Prevention
      content: Social engineering is among the most reliable methods for fraudsters to
        access accounts of your trusted customers. Phishing techniques can also
        be notoriously difficult to prevent. Websites can stop phishing fraud
        with FingerprintJS Pro's accurate visitor identification by requiring
        new and untrusted visitors to provide additional authentication before
        accessing their accounts.
