**CHICAGO – March 8, 2023 –** [Fingerprint](https://fingerprint.com/), the world's most accurate device identifier, experienced substantial revenue and platform usage growth during its most recent fiscal year, which ended January 31. The company welcomed new executive leadership, expanded their SDKs and open-source library offerings, and introduced support for new use cases.

Fingerprint empowers developers to build safe and seamless websites and is used by some of the most popular sites, including Dropbox, Realtor.com, and Neiman Marcus. Its device identifier can identify returning users with 99.5% accuracy, far surpassing the industry standard. This accuracy persists for months, while other methods of device identification are less accurate and only last for days or weeks. 

Founded in 2012 as an [open-source library](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs), which has since accumulated over 18 thousand GitHub stars and is downloaded over 300 thousand times a week, Fingerprint is used by 16% of the top 500 websites to detect fraudulent activity. This includes automated attacks, phishing attempts, payment fraud, and multi-accounting schemes. Over the past year, usage of Fingerprint’s VisitorID has expanded beyond fraud detection. By accurately identifying users, Fingerprint’s customers can improve conversions, better attribute marketing spend, and provide best-in-class user experiences while reducing fraudulent events.

> “Last year marked another year of record growth across the company. We not only more than tripled annual revenue and product users, we also tripled employee headcount while still maintaining a 100% remote team. \
> \
> This level of growth is a testament to how fundamental high-accuracy device fingerprinting is instrumental in solving fraud, providing a seamless experience on thousands of websites, and gaining unprecedented user insights across multiple touchpoints.” - Dan Pinto, CEO and co-founder of Fingerprint.
