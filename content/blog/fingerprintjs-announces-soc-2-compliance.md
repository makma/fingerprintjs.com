> November 2022 Update: We're now SOC Type II compliant. You can read more [here](/blog/soc-2-type-2/?&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=blog). 

Fingerprint is committed to keeping our customer and company data safe to the highest possible standards.

That’s why today we are excited to share that we received our SOC 2 Type 1 report for our company and our Pro offering, which validates our commitment to best-in-class data security and privacy.

For companies that require SOC 2 compliance or simply value the added assurance from their technology partners, there has never been a better time to start working with us.

## What is SOC 2 Compliance?

SOC (Systems and Operational Controls) 2 is a set of standards that companies can adopt to ensure customer and company data is safeguarded. 

SOC 2 outlines five Trust Services Criteria that are used to assess whether a company’s processes, controls and tools appropriately address their data security and privacy needs:

* **Security**: the protection of data and systems from unauthorized users.
* **Availability**: the maintenance, monitoring, and performance of infrastructure and network.
* **Processing integrity**: the ability of systems to perform as intended without error, delay, omission, or manipulation. 
* **Confidentiality**: the protection of data that should be restricted to specific people or companies.
* **Privacy**: the safeguarding of personally identifiable information from unauthorized users.

## About The Report

By becoming SOC 2 compliant, we can now provide interested parties with our Type 1 report. This report contains details on how we are keeping our customers data safe:

* Customer data protection
* Continuous monitoring
* Incident response protocols
* Employee security training

## What’s Next

SOC 2 compliance is only one of many steps we plan to take to ensure best-in-class security for our customers. We are planning to achieve SOC 2 Type 2 compliance in the next year. This next step will require an ongoing audit of the security procedures outlined in our Type 1 report.
