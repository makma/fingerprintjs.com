Additionally, We’re co-hosting an event with [Spec](https://www.specprotected.com/) on [March 8th from 7:00 - 9:00 PM](https://try.fingerprint.com/en-us/join-us-merchant-risk-council-2023?&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=merchant-risk-council-2023) at Javier’s at the Aria, where you can enjoy tacos, tequila, margaritas, and mingle with other fraud fighters. At this event, you will learn more about Fingerprint, a device identification platform that uses browser fingerprinting and device identification to detect and prevent fraud across multiple use cases. 

Companies in the eCommerce space use Fingerprint to keep chargebacks to a minimum and protect their bottom-line and seller reputation. Fingerprint Pro allows these companies to input our visitorId into their data models and quickly catch more fraud attempts, as it provides them with more insight into patterns of behavior, such as friendly fraud or coupon and promo abuse.
