We are increasing the price of FingerprintJS Pro for all new paying accounts starting on or after January 1, 2022.

Our new pricing will be $2 for 1,000 API calls. For all On-Demand customers, pricing will still be billed based on monthly usage, with the minimum paid plan starting at $200 for 100,000 API calls. The free plan will continue to allow up to 20,000 API calls per month at no cost.

This is a 100% increase from our current pricing. We have had the same price since 2019 - now it is finally time to adjust to current market conditions.

### For current paying customers

All current paying customers will be grandfathered into their current pricing plan and will not have their rates increased. The current On-Demand price is $1 for 1,000 API calls.

The billing method and payment period associated with your account will not change.

### For free plan customers, and those new to FingerprintJS Pro

All accounts that upgrade to a paid plan before January 1st will lock in our old pricing and not have their rate increased. This represents 50% off our future price. If you are considering becoming a paying customer in the future, we recommend signing up in December before prices increase.

For those who are ramping up FingerprintJS Pro usage but are on a free plan today, we recommend upgrading to the minimum On-Demand plan to lock in the discounted rate. Free plan customers can upgrade to a paid On-Demand plan in the Pro dashboard after logging in. If you expect your account will make 1+ million API requests per month, please [contact sales](https://fingerprintjs.com/contact-sales/) for custom enterprise plans.

Those new to FingerprintJS Pro can [sign up for free](https://dashboard.fingerprintjs.com/signup) and get unlimited API calls for 10 days.
