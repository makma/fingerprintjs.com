We are increasing the price of FingerprintJS Pro for all new paying accounts starting on January 1, 2022.

Our new pricing will be $2 for 1,000 API calls. For all On-Demand customers, pricing will still be billed based on monthly usage, with the minimum paid plan starting at $200 for 100,000 API calls. The free plan will continue to allow up to 20,000 API calls per month at no cost.

This is a 100% increase from our current pricing. We have had the same price since 2019 and have invested heavily in the product since then, adding new features, increasing visitorID accuracy, and improving ease of use. Ultimately we believe that the service is now much more valuable to our customers, and plan to continue investing in Pro improvements in the coming year.

### For current paying customers

All current paying customers will be grandfathered into their current pricing plan and will not have their rates increased. The current On-Demand price is $1 for 1,000 API calls.

The billing method and payment period associated with your account will not change.

### For free plan customers, and those new to FingerprintJS Pro

All accounts that upgrade to a paid plan before January 1st will lock in our old pricing and not have their rate increased. This represents 50% off our future price. If you are considering becoming a paying customer in the future, we recommend signing up in December before prices increase.

For those who are ramping up FingerprintJS Pro usage but are on a free plan today, we recommend upgrading to the minimum On-Demand plan to lock in the discounted rate. Free plan customers can upgrade to a paid On-Demand plan in the Pro dashboard after logging in. If you expect your account will make 1+ million API requests per month, please [contact sales](https://fingerprintjs.com/contact-sales/) for custom enterprise plans.

Those new to FingerprintJS Pro can [sign up for free](https://dashboard.fingerprintjs.com/signup) and get unlimited API calls for 10 days.
