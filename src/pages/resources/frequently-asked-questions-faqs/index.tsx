            Yes, every time the API is called to generate a visitorID, even if for the same user, it will count towards

              Browser fingerprinting is a technique of identifying a website&apos;s visitors to be uniquely identifiable

              For a business, browser fingerprinting aims to identify visitors to a site better and separate those that

            Device identification is a process in which several signals from a device, user, browser, etc are collected

            Browser fingerprinting is just one of the many signal collection forms incorporated into device

            To generate our unique VisitorID, Fingerprint incorporates device identification and browser fingerprinting.

              can appear in several forms, including credential stuffing and phishing attempts.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.faqContent}>
              With credential stuffing, fraudsters will try to test thousands of login details they’ve obtained from an
              external source like a data breach of another site to try and gain access to a user’s accounts. This
              happens when users reuse passwords or unsecured passwords across multiple sites.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.faqContent}>
              Phishing attempts are some of the most challenging fraud attempts to detect due to their level of social
              engineering sophistication. Phishing attempts happen in several ways, including through email, social
              media, phone calls, false web pages, and even direct mail.

              Multi-accounting fraud is when one person signs up for multiple accounts with the same service. This can
              happen for non-nefarious reasons or in attempts to gain something, including a winning advantage in an
              online poker game.
